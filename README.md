# Hunting For Foxes

 The _first_ project on the **Python**.
 
 To play in the "Fox Hunt" you will need a 10X10 field. The foxes are hidden on the field. From the beginning you specify the coordinates. If there is a fox there, then you will be informed. Otherwise, you will be told how many foxes there are on the given vertical, horizontals, diagonals.
 You need to find all 5 foxes. **Pleasant game!**
